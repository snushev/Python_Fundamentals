# Get the user's choice and store it in a variable
choice = input("Enter the number of your choice (1-4): ")

# If the user chooses Strings (choice == '1'):
if choice == '1':
# Declare a string variable, e.g., sentence = "Learning Python is fun!"

# Extract and print a substring, such as the word "Python" from the sentence.

# Convert the entire sentence to uppercase and print it.

# Replace a word in the sentence (e.g., replace "fun" with "awesome") and print the modified sentence.

# If the user chooses Numbers (choice == '2'):
elif choice == '2':
# Prompt the user to input two numbers, e.g., num1 and num2.

# Perform and print the results of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

# Handle division by zero (e.g., print an error message if num2 is zero).

# Perform a power operation, raising num1 to the power of num2, and print the result.

# If the user chooses Booleans (choice == '3'):
elif choice == '3':
# Declare two boolean variables, e.g., is_python_fun = True, is_sunny = False.

# Perform and print the results of logical operations: AND, OR, NOT.

# Perform and print the results of comparison operations (e.g., 10 > 5 and 5 == 5).

# If the user chooses Additional Data Types (choice == '4'):
elif choice == '4':
# ### List Operations ###
# Create a list with mixed data types (e.g., numbers, strings, booleans).

# Append a new element to the list and print the updated list.

# Access and print the 4th element in the list.

# ### Tuple Operations ###
# Create a tuple with some string elements (e.g., fruits).

# Print the length of the tuple.

# Try to modify one element in the tuple and handle the resulting TypeError.

# ### Dictionary Operations ###
# Create a dictionary with some key-value pairs (e.g., name, age, city).

# Access and print the value for one of the keys (e.g., "age").

# Add a new key-value pair to the dictionary and print the updated dictionary.

# If the user enters an invalid choice:
else:
# Print an error message indicating an invalid selection.
